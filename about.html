        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am Michael Levin, a dedicated computer science and mathematics student at UCLA with a passion for software engineering. My experience includes working on projects that have enhanced user experiences for thousands of users, optimizing system performance, and developing robust applications using various programming languages. I thrive in environments where I can leverage technology to solve complex problems efficiently.</p>
        <p>My journey into software development began with a curiosity about how technology can be used to improve everyday life. Since then, I have honed my skills in languages such as Dart, C++, and Python, and have gained valuable experience through internships and personal projects.</p>
        <p>Outside of programming, I enjoy exploring history, lifting weights, and playing board games. These hobbies keep me grounded and provide a creative outlet that complements my technical pursuits.</p>
