        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am Michael Levin, a computer science and mathematics student at UCLA with a passion for solving complex problems and creating impactful solutions. During my internship at Charge Health, I optimized user experiences for over 10,000 users, and as a Technical Recruitment Coordinator for the Lanhee Chen Campaign, I led recruitment efforts, driving significant volunteer engagement.</p>
        <p>My project experience includes developing a Clinic Finder application with Flutter and AWS, creating a full-stack banking application using Java and Spring Boot, and building a machine learning model in Python to predict housing prices. I am proficient in Dart, Java, C++, Python, and SQL, and skilled in using frameworks like Flutter, Spring Boot, and React to drive innovation and deliver excellence in my work.</p>
        <p>Outside of programming, I enjoy exploring history, lifting weights, and playing board games, which keep me grounded and provide a creative balance to my technical endeavors.</p>
